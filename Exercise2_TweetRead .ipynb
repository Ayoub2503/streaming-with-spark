    "This program use the **Tweepy** library to get the tweets from Twitter API using Python and passes them to the Spark Streaming instance.\n",
    "$\\newline$First, we set up our **Twitter credentials** to have the authorization to take tweets from it. Next, we will create a TweetsListener, which is a class that inherit from the StreamLister class, and it would be responsible for the streaming itself. For initialization, we provide a socket object and implement two methods : on_data and on_error. The first method is responsible for receiving data from the Twitter stream and sending it to a socket. The second is used for receiving error messages and printing it.\n",
    "$\\newline$ Then, we connect to Twitter streaming by using the **sendTweets** method which will have a socket object as a parameter and create a stream object instance.\n",
    "$\\newline$Finally, to start streaming, we create a socket object, obtain the local machine name which is **'127.0.0.1'**, reserve a port for your service on the host, bind to the port, wait for a client connection which would be from the **streaming** notebook and call **sendTweets** method to build a new connection, and here we will pick all the tweets containing the covid and newyear tag."
